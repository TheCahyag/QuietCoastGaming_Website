    Implemented:
        - added a class in style.css for individual messages
        - Post objects now save the ip of the person who created the post
        - fixed some issues in create-thread.php, started to create the contents of the file for the thread
        - findRelativeDirectory.php is a function that, given a directory, will return the path you need to take inorder to get to the root level of the project
        - fixed directories in head.php and menu.php so it doesn't matter where the file is, it will be able to access the links to other files on the website
        - When creating a post or thread I have started to add tips on how you can format text
    
    Deleted:
        - constants.php turns out it doesn't look like I'm going to need this
        - menuForum.php, headForum.php - the original files now dynamically set the links to other pages based on the file that is accessing the info from head and menu

        - delete-post.php
        - delete-thread.php

    Implemented:
        - Fixed/Added/Edited some comments
        - Made the Forum object and serialized it when creating a forum
        - Finished editing what is put in the file when a new forum is created (still needs to be tested)
        - Forum object now keeps track of its name, along with a getter function
        - Finished (I think) generate-forum.php script (which looks through all the forums and adds rows to a table based on the forum info)
        - Worked out a function to generate rows for a table which contain information about all threads in a given forum (generate-threads.php)
        - Added a method for Thread objects to get the most recent post in a given thread and to get the file pathway to the given thread
        - Most of the create/delete function scripts are empty atm, that is more of a visual todo for my sake

    Added:
        - testCreateForum.php (a test that creates a forum)
        - getNameForFile.php
        - forumcreation.php
    
    Implemented:
        - create-forum.php: gets called from forumcreation.php and will have a name in the _GET var named 'name' it parses the name into a filename creates that file, makes a directory for the threads to be stored in and adds html stuff to fill up the page which isn't correct right now because it searches forums and not threads, so I gotta fix that.
        - configured the filename of the forum in the constructor in Forum.php along with some getter functions
        - Worked on generate-forums.php since I already had that code from create-forum (which was incorrect, but works here) and am currently working on getting the objects to work after being serialized. Doesn't currently work
        - Added getter functions in Post.php, made it possible to access the author, content, and date of a given post which should prove useful when I look at the most recent post and need to get the date of it
        - Added getter functions in Thread.php, made it possible to access the array of posts a thread holds (to find the most recent post)
        - getNameForFile.php is a function that will be used to take a name of a given forum/thread and parse it to be an acceptable file name
        - Made webpages look for the style sheet at a http link instead of a link that was based on the file system
        - Changed a bunch of include statements to incorporate the DOCUMENT_ROOT var under the _SERVER var array
        - forumcreation.php is the page that will initiate the creation of a forum, it's just a text box and a button that runs create-forum.php with the text from the textbox

    Implemented:
        - Forum.php
            - getThreadCount() and getPostCount() were deleted and replaced with methods that used the list of Threads and Posts to obtain data
            - methods (createThread, appendThread) to create a new thread (still needs work)
        - Thread.php
            - Changed contructor to take in an array for various string data, and a post representing the first post.
            - No longer keep track of first\mostrecent posts and now just keep all posts in a ArrayObject list. The first post is the first object in the list and the most recent post is the last object in the list.
        - Removed extraneous <div> tags in various webpages and templates
