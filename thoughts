Forum:
- pages of forums
- how to sort (newest first?) nah prob newest last oldest first
- mark posts as done (lock them)?
- ways of deleteing forums and rearranging them
- save data from new post so if anything goes wrong you display
error message and then return the user to a data entry forum with
his original data

- need to check content for single and double quotes so they don't
f up the scripts

- record ip when posts/threads are created
- and make it so you can ban ips so they can't post anywhere
- limit to how many threads/posts you can have to prevent spam

all of the redirects should more specifically send the user instead
of just redirecting to the forum

- need to fix the highlighting on the table rows under the forum page

Things to improve upon the first release of the website:
- Change creation pages to modals called by the same buttons that call
the separate creation page (http://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/components/modal/#via-javascript)
